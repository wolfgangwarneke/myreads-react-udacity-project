# _MyReads_

#### _A reading list project for Udacity's React Nanodegree, 9.14.2017_

#### By _**Wolfgang Warneke**_

## About this MyReads project

This is my submission for the React Fundamentals course project. It is a reading list app which uses a limited sandbox API for its book data. A user may add book to their current reading list, a reading wish list, or a list of books already read. A user may click on a book for more information and search for new books to add.
